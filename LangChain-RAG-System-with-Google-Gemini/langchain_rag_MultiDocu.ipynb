Infini-attention allows LLMs to handle infinitely long input sequences with limited memory and computation by combining compressive memory, masked local attention, and long-term linear attention within a single Transformer block.  This approach enables continual pre-training and fine-tuning on extended contexts.  The effectiveness of Infini-attention is demonstrated on long-context language modeling, passkey retrieval with 1M sequence length, and book summarization with 500K length using 1B and 8B parameter LLMs."
